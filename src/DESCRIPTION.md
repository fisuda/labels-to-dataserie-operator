The Labels to dataserie operator operator is a WireCloud operator that provides the ability to transform a label series into a number series, so it can be used with other components like the `calculate-tendency operator` and the `column-chart-generator operator`.

**NOTE:**
This WireCloud operator is based on labels-to-dataserie-operator of [agile-dashboards](https://github.com/Wirecloud/agile-dashboards)
created by CoNWeT Lab., Universidad Politecnica de Madrid and Future Internet Consulting and Development Solutions S.L..
